Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI
I recently developed an interactive Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard in Power BI, designed to provide a genderâ€‘wise and ageâ€‘wise exploration of cardiovascular health.
The solution emphasizes survival trends, clinical indicators, and key risk factors, enabling deeper insights into patient outcomes.
ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Survival Metrics: Dynamic breakdown of survival rate, total deaths, and average age of survival.
- Clinical Trends: Visualization of serum creatinine and ejection fraction patterns across demographics.
- Risk Profiling: Analysis of comorbidities such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and anaemia.
- Interactive Filters: Genderâ€‘based segmentation (Male, Female, Overall) for comparative analysis.


ðŸ§® DAXâ€‘Driven Measures
- Total Deaths
- Total Survivals
- Survival Rate (%)
- Average Age of Survival
ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- Survival rates are significantly higher in younger age groups.
- Males in the 51â€“60 age group exhibit elevated serum creatinine levels.
- Females under 40 demonstrate a 100% survival rate, unlike their male counterparts.
- High blood pressure and diabetes are more prevalent in specific middleâ€‘aged cohorts.
