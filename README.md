# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Power-BI-project
An interactive data-driven dashboard built in Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize heart disease survival trends across gender and age groups. This project leverages medical and demographic data to uncover insights into survival rates, comorbidities, and key clinical indicators.

🔍 Overview
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of cardiovascular health by highlighting:
- Total Deaths and Survivals
- Survival Rate & Average Age of Survival
- Gender-based Comparisons (Male, Female, Overall)
- Key Health Factors: Serum Creatinine, Ejection Fraction, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia, Smoking, Diabetes


📊 Visuals Included
- Survival Rate by Age Group
- Death Count vs. Serum Creatinine
- Death Count vs. Ejection Fraction
- Spline Chart of Comorbidities
- Gender Toggle for Comparative Analysis


⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI for interactive dashboards
- DAX for custom measures and calculations
- Data Cleaning & Modeling for structured analysis


📎 Use Cases
- Health Risk Profiling by demographic segments
- Identifying High-Risk Age Groups for cardiac events
- Gender-Based Comparative Analysis of survival and risk factors
- Medical Data Storytelling through interactive dashboards


🚀 Key Takeaways
- Younger age groups show higher survival rates.
- Females under 40 demonstrate 100% survival compared to males.
- Males in the 51–60 age group exhibit elevated serum creatinine levels.
- Comorbidities such as high blood pressure and diabetes are concentrated in middle-aged cohorts.
